<h1>Battery Replacement iPhone 8 Plus</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab we will go through the process of replacing the battery of a modern smartphone, in this case the iPhone 8 Plus. Virtually all modern smartphones have batteries which are housed in the sealed casing of the device, making their replacement difficult. However with some easily obtainable tools and using care and proper repair techniques, we can replace a worn smartphone battery, allowing us to improve the usability and extend the life of the device, saving us the cost of having to purchase a new device and avoiding uneccessary electronic waste. 
<br>Symptoms that indicate a need for a battery replacement include rapid draining of the charge and unexpected shutdowns. iOS contains a feature which measures the Battery Health of the battery, and it is generally recommended to replace the battery after it reaches around 80% of its rated initial capacity. Android devices also usually contain this feature, located in another menu depending on the device.</br>
<br>This lab will definitely develop our skills as a repair technician and give us the competency and confidence to repair other kinds of computing devices.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

Most of these tools (except the glue, hairdryer and isopropyl alcohol) will come included in any inexpensive repair kit available for purchase online. It may also be advisable to use latex gloves for hygiene, and an anti-static mat and wrist-strap, particularly if the device is not yours. 

- 1 size 0 Philips head screwdriver
- 1 0.8mm/P2 Pentalobe head screwdriver
- 1 suction cup 
- 1 two-sided pastic spudger
- 3 triangular spudgers
- Tweezers
- B-7000 Glue (or a gasket made for your exact device)
- A hair dryer or a heatgun
- 99% isopropyl alcohol
- A suitable work table

<h2>Repair walk-through</h2>

1. Prior to opening up the phone, it would be a good idea to make a backup of the device's crucial information in case of data loss. This is not at all likely, but routine backups are always a good practice. It will also help to investigate the battery section of the phone's settings to ensure that a replacement is necessary and that excessive battery draining is due to battery wear and not something else.

2. The first step of any repair process is to assemble and organize all your tools, the device and the replacement part on a clean and suitable table. Tools to avoid static discharge are also highly recommended, however in this case, as it is my device, I will forgo them. It will be necessary to keep track of the tiny screws, so make sure to save a place for them that will enable us to remember their location on the device.

 3. To begin opening the device, first we will unscrew the two pentalobe screws at the bottom of the phone surrounding the lightning port, using our 0.8mm pentalobe head screwdriver. Place the screws in a safe location away from the work zone to avoid losing them. Then we will begin to use a hair dryer or a heatgun to loosen up the seal of glue between the screen and the frame of the phone. Focusing on the bottom left of the phone, run the hair dryer or heat gun for about 15 seconds to heat up the glue. Once this is complete, apply the suction cup to the screen. Using the two-sided spudger and gently pulling on the suction cup, gently pry into the seal and make a small opening between the screen and the frame, taking care not to go too far into the device and hit any wires. Place a triangular spudger in the opening to hold it apart. Now with the opening secured, use another triangular spudger to gently slide around the rest of the seal and break it, using the hair dryer at intervals to losen the glue along the way. Place one or two more spudgers around the phone to hold the screen and frame apart. Be sure to not overly pry the screen to avoid breaking it. Once we are finished the process, the screen can be gently opened to the right like a book.

 4. After we have finished opening the screen, first we will use the double-sided spudger to carefully clean away left over glue residue from the frame. This will allow for a clean and tight seal when we apply fresh glue after replacing the battery. Next we will unscrew the 4 philips screws from the plate covering the battery connector cable, grabbing them with the tweezers. There are two types of screws, so we will make sure to store them safely away from the work zone and to remember their placement for later. Then we will use the double-sided spudger to gently un-clip the battery connecter cable, second from the bottom of the connector array.

 5. Now that the battery is disconnected, we can remove it. Begin by peeling up the tape holding the four "pull tabs" which hold the battery to the frame, two at the top and two at the bottom. After this, gently pull them away, level to the table. They often snap before coming loose, so it may be necessary to gently pry up the battery with the double-sided spudger and place a few drops of 99% isopropyl alcohol underneath the battery. This will dissolve the glue, and by angling the spudger underneath the battery and sliding it in, the battery should come off with a bit of gentle pressure.

6. Finally, to conclude our replacement of the battery, first place some double-sided tape in the battery encasement, avoiding the opening for wireless charging. Then, as you place the battery in the encasement, line up the battery connector cable to its connection before securing the battery, as the tolerance is low. Secure the battery in its place and press the connector into the socket. Next, replace the plate covering this area and re-insert the four philips head screws with the philips screwdriver. To check that the battery is working, fold back the screen gently and press the power button to start up the device. Once the battery function is verified, turn the device off again. Finally we can reseal the device. Using either the B-7000 glue or a new gasket if available, carefully apply it to the groove around the edge of the frame. Then, with some gentle pressure, carefully reset the screen. Lastly, replace the two pentalobe screws at the bottom of the device.

It takes around 24 hours for the glue's bond to fully form, so either place it in the device's case to hold it in place, or use a pair of plastic clamps to hold it together for 24 hours.</br>
<br>The device will likely require some cleaning with the spudger around the frame to remove excess glue, however it is advised to wait until 24 hours have passed to allow for a tight seal to form. Unfortunately, the factory IP-67 dust and water resistence of the iPhone will be lost, so try to avoid getting the phone wet to avoid water damage (although the seal should be decently good to keep out water and/or dust in normal use cases). Remember to also safely dispose of the old battery at the appropriate disposal station.</br>
<br>
After the replacement is complete, we can hopefully see in the battery settings that our battery health is back to 100%, and can enjoy the extended life of our smartphone for a fraction of the cost of a new one!</br>
